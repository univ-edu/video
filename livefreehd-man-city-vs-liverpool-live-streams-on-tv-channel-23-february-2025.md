Check out the live streaming details for Manchester City vs Liverpool Premier League 2024–25 match.

A pivotal clash that could shape the title race is looming as Manchester City host Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday.

Pep Guardiola’s squad will be keen to recover from their recent 3-1 loss to Real Madrid, a setback that cost them a vital knockout opportunity.

Similarly, Liverpool are determined to restore their winning form following a lackluster 2-2 draw with Aston Villa midweek, a result that saw them win just two of their last five games across all competitions.

Manchester City are today looking to respond in the Premier League when they host Liverpool in a huge game.

Man City were thrashed by Real Madrid in the Champions League on Wednesday night, underlining just how far they’ve fallen this season.

Pep Guardiola suffered another injury blow in Wednesday's defeat to Real Madrid as John Stones was forced off in the first half. Stones has been nursing a foot issue for most of the year but it appeared that this was something new. While fans await more news on the extent of the issue, it's hard to imagine Stones being available for action so soon.

He joins Manuel Akanji, Oscar Bobb, and Rodri on the shelf, all of whom have missed signifiant time and will likely continue to do so. Bobb was scheduled to return from his broken leg but reportedly twisted his ankle in training, lengthening his return timeline.

Erling Haaland did not feature in the Real Madrid match midweek after tweaking his knee last weekend, but he was on the bench as an unused substitute. He's considered a doubt for this weekend with no real update on his availability.
